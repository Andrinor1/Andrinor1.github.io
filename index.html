                            My name is Griffin Clos. I'm working towards my Media and Game Design degree at UW-Whitewater, and currently looking for a job that will carry me into the future.</br>
                            I have a passion when it comes to Game Design, and work well both on my own as well as in a team setting.</br>
                            I've recently been playing Fire Emblem Engage, Your Only Move Is Hustle, and DOTA 2!

                    This game was created by myself as well as two classmates, Sylvester Kaestner and Blake Prasch. </br>
                    I did much of the coding using p5js, while Sylvester contributed art and Blake did audio as well as some coding.

                    This is a turn-based text RPG. You choose a class, and fight monsters. There is a neat little story that goes along with it. </br>
                    I wrote much of the code, along with a friend Juan Flores, and the story is attributed to Silas Bruno. This was the first project we worked on together, and used object-oriented programming before my classmates understood the concept. I understand the concepts of Object-Oriented programming and can both apply them to projects as well as teach others how it works.

                    The project was completed with Juan Flores and Silas Bruno. The key feature of this project was the ability to read and save files, and our method of creating a game in which anyone could create a dungeon of their own to adventure through.
