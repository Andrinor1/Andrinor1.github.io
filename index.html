                            My name is Griffin Clos. I am a Game Developer who recently graduated from UW-Whitewater, and I'm 'currently looking for a job that will carry me into the future!</br>
                            Game design is my passion, but I also have strong skills in computer science and programming, both as an individual as well as when working in a group.</br>
                            I recently finished playing The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom as well as Baldur's Gate 3!

                    Getting Ahead is a couch co-op game about trying to escape a cursed forest by decapitating enemies, and taking over their bodies. Plug in some controllers, and get started!</br>
                    This project was the focus of one of my Capstone classes at UW-Whitewater.</br>
                    I worked on the Camera, the UI systems, Audio, and the design of the game itself, as well as working with the art team to make sure due dates were met.

                    I worked on this alongside Joseph Yang and Kaitlin Southard. </br>
                    Level design and game systems were my focus on this project. It was shown in the UWW MAGD 2023 Expo!

                    I did much of the coding using p5js, while Sylvester contributed art and Blake did audio as well as some coding.

                    This is a turn-based text RPG. You choose a class, and fight monsters. There is a neat little story that goes along with it. </br>
                    I wrote much of the code, along with a friend Juan Flores, and the story is attributed to Silas Bruno. This was the first project we worked on together, and used object-oriented programming before my classmates understood the concept. I understand the concepts of Object-Oriented programming and can both apply them to projects as well as teach others how it works.

                    The project was completed with Juan Flores and Silas Bruno. The key feature of this project was the ability to read and save files, and our method of creating a game in which anyone could create a dungeon of their own to adventure through.
